#/* Given a string str and an integer k, you need to reverse the first k characters
#   for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string.
#   If there are less than k characters left, reverse all of them.
#   If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters,
#   then reverse the first k characters and left the other as original.
#
#   Example:
#
#   Input: abcdefg 2
#   Output: bacdfeg
#
#   The first 2 characters "ab" are reversed, the next 2 characters "cd" are not, and the last 3 characters "efg" are reversed.
